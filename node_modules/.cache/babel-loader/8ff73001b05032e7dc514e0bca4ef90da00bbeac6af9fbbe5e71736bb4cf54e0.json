I was able to fill a lot of gaps in my knowledge about REST APIs as well, since this was my second time working with it! \n                                I'd love to take CPSC 404 in the next term and learn more relational databases. \n                                <br></br> \n                                <br></br> \n                                Github repository link <a href='https://github.com/logank8/304-database-project'>here</a>!\n                                </body>\n                        </AccordionItemPanel>\n                    </AccordionItem>\n                    <AccordionItem>\n                        <AccordionItemHeading>\n                            <AccordionItemButton>\n                            Waitlist Tracker bot\n                            </AccordionItemButton>\n                        </AccordionItemHeading>\n                        <AccordionItemPanel>\n                        <body>\n                        This is a script I wrote with Python, Discord.py, and Selenium to check a few different UBC courses. \n                        I've been wanting to work with Selenium for a while now, and this was a great great chance. \n                        And of course, I always love Python.\n                        <br></br>\n                        It would be great to do some more automation stuff in the future!!\n                        <br></br>\n                        Github repository link <a href=\"https://github.com/logank8/waitlist-bot-script\">here</a>!\n                        </body>\n                        </AccordionItemPanel>\n                    </AccordionItem>\n                    <AccordionItem>\n                        <AccordionItemHeading>\n                            <AccordionItemButton>\n                            Song Popularity Predictor\n                            </AccordionItemButton>\n                        </AccordionItemHeading>\n                        <AccordionItemPanel>\n                        <body>\n                        This is by far my favorite project I've done, and I keep wanting to come back to it and do more. I made a machine learning model using a Random Forest algorithm with the scikit Python library and some synthetic data from Kaggle.\n                        I made a little web app in Flask to demonstrate it, and used the Tekore.py library to gather some more data for an interactive search-and-test component. \n                        One thing that I would love to do now is write a Python automation script to gather some mass of data from the Tekore library and then create test and train datasets off of that, because the Kaggle data wasn't as accurate as I would've liked (and the Tekore library definitely is).\n                        As it stands, though, I'm still proud of what I've done with it because I always love Random Forest models.\n                        <br></br>\n                        Github repository link <a href=\"https://github.com/logank8/flask-model\">here</a>!\n                        </body>\n                        </AccordionItemPanel>\n                    </AccordionItem>\n                    <AccordionItem>\n                        <AccordionItemHeading>\n                            <AccordionItemButton>\n                            UBC REX Undergraduate Research Experience Program\n                            </AccordionItemButton>\n                        </AccordionItemHeading>\n                        <AccordionItemPanel>\n                        <body>\n                        I worked with three others under a mentor from the UBC Linguistics department to create an evaluation of a Text-To-Speech system for Ojibwe, using an eye-tracking system to measure pupillometry. \n                        We met weekly and I got to learn a ton about the research process (writing literature reviews, abstracts, etc.) and statistical analysis used in the research process.\n                        In March 2023, we presented a hypothetical study and its relevance with the team at the UBC MURC (Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference).

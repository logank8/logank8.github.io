I had such a great time and got to meet a lot of great people!\n\n                        Some clips from our presentation:\n                        <br></br>\n                        \n                        <img src={rexpic1} alt=\"REX\" width='50%' style={{margin:'0px 10px'}}></img>\n                        <img src={rexpic3} alt=\"REX\" width='50%' style={{margin:'0px 10px'}}></img>\n                        <img src={rexpic2} alt=\"REX\" width='50%' style={{margin:'0px 10px'}}></img>\n                        \n                        </body>\n                        </AccordionItemPanel>\n                    </AccordionItem>\n                    <AccordionItem>\n                        <AccordionItemHeading>\n                            <AccordionItemButton>\n                            CPSC 310 UBC Pair Data API\n                            </AccordionItemButton>\n                        </AccordionItemHeading>\n                        <AccordionItemPanel>\n                        <body>\n                        Me and a partner developed a query engine in TypeScript for the UBC PAIR dataset, created a RESTful API connected to the query engine, and then wrote a simple frontend to connect to and display it.\n                        Although it was super super arduous, I feel like this class actually taught me a lot about the value of testing your code, and about all the different types of tests you can add to a test suite. \n                        We got to do glass box testing and black box testing, which was fun. \n                        <br></br>\n                        All the tech tools we used: TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, mocha.ts, Express, Postman\n                        <br></br>\n                        Project demo <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15rXVJ38zvVF2wrSaxeGKHLRKW52RLJc-?usp=share_link\">here</a>!\n                        </body>\n                        </AccordionItemPanel>\n                        </AccordionItem>\n                        <AccordionItem>\n                            <AccordionItemHeading>\n                                <AccordionItemButton>\n                                Node.js webscraper\n                                </AccordionItemButton>\n                            </AccordionItemHeading>\n                            <AccordionItemPanel>\n                            <body>\n                            The purpose of creating this was to provide a model of how to scrape the UBC course listing website at each level (so others can adapt it efficiently and use it for their own purposes 😉)\n                            <br></br>\n\n        I originally had attempted to do the html navigation with Python's Selenium library, but later found that the node.js Puppeteer library is much better for these purposes!\n                            <br></br>\n        ** do NOT run this, it takes up a lot of memory; I am currently working on changing it to write to a csv which will likely take less memory space !! The script can be used/copied for personal use though. I am not endorsing using this for any sort of automated enrollment as I'm pretty sure that is extremely not allowed!!!! However...if someone wanted to use my code for that, that's none of my business.\n                            <br></br>\n                            Github repository link <a href=\"https://github.com/logank8/ubc-webscrape\">here</a>!\n                            </body>\n                            </AccordionItemPanel>\n                        </AccordionItem>\n                        \n                </Accordion>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"column\">\n            <h2>\n                    my education history\n                </h2>\n                <body class=\"info-text\">\n                    I spent my first year of university at <a href=\"https://simons-rock.edu/\">Bard College at Simon's Rock</a>:\n                    <br></br>\n                    \n                    <img class='pic1' src={bardpic\n                } alt=\"Bard College at Simon's Rock\">\n                    </img>\n                    \n                    <br></br>\n                    Then I transferred to <a href=\"https://ubc.ca/\">UBC Vancouver</a> to major in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics!\n                    \n                    <br></br>\n                    <img style={{marginLeft:'50%'}} class='pic1' src={vanpic\n                } alt=\"Vancouver\">\n                    </img>\n                    <br></br>\n                    I finished my 3rd year in May 2023;
